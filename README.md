As you may have probably seen, my name is Robin Bourachot, or as I call myself on Internet, Ciborn. I'm French but not toxic and I've been developing since 2013, when I got my own PC. I started with C++ (not the best language to start with, but my parents gave me a book about C++ as a gift to get me started, so I did with what I had).

## My current project~~s~~
The only actual thing I am currently working on is a Discord bot named [Aldebaran](https://aldebaran.nightorn.com/home/). It's a multi-purposes bot which is mostly used as a DiscordRPG assistant (because of the variety of tools it offers to improve the player experience), but it can do a lot of things from social/GIF commands to literally random commands!
